The loss functions for the soft and hard constraints cases are named loss_functions_soft_constraints.py and loss_functions_hard_constraints.py respectively. The loss_functions file contains the loss functions of the original vanilla version of DeepReach by Bansal et al. It is there just for reference and does not bear any direct use as of now.

The experiment scripts for running the soft and hard constraints cases are in the same folder as the above mentioned loss function files. The names of those scripts are 2D_Example_Soft_Constraints.py, 2D_Example_Soft_Constraints.py, train_hji_air3D_soft_constraints.py and train_hji_air3D_hard_constraints.py respectively. The experiment scripts folder contains the experiment scripts of the original vanilla version of DeepReach by Bansal et al. It is there just for reference and does not bear any direct use as of now.
